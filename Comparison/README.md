## ü¶Å RAPID-Net's Advantage for Docking: The Case of 8F4J Protein  

This subfolder contains several **screenshots** highlighting key limitations of AlphaFold 3 and demonstrating how our model's precise pocket predictions effectively overcome these challenges. These images are also referenced in the demo notebooks to visually illustrate the concepts being discussed.

## Screenshots Overview

  This screenshot displays references to **other Neural Networks** that **AlphaFold 3 draws inspiration from**. Both these networks and AlphaFold 3 rely on FPocket to identify potential binding sites, but its inaccuracies lead to an excessively large search grid.

- **[FPocket.png](https://github.com/BalytskyiJaroslaw/RAPID-Net/blob/main/Comparison/FPocket.png)**  
  This image illustrates the usage of **FPocket**, a pocket detection algorithm employed by those Neural Networks. However, **FPocket's predictions are too inaccurate**, leading to an **overwhelmingly large search grid** when attempting to process large proteins like **8F4J**.

- **[Factorize_8F4J.png](https://github.com/BalytskyiJaroslaw/RAPID-Net/blob/main/Comparison/Factorize_8F4J.png)**  
  This screenshot shows the **search grid generated using RAPID-Net's pocket prediction**. Unlike FPocket, RAPID-Net produces **compact and accurate pocket predictions**, drastically **reducing computational cost**. This enables efficient **ligand docking with AutoDock Vina** without the excessive computational overhead caused by an unnecessarily large search space.


## üîë Key Takeaway  

While **AlphaFold 3** struggles with **handling large proteins** due to its reliance on **FPocket's inaccurate predictions** üß©, our **RAPID-Net** model successfully **identifies compact and precise pockets** üéØ. This drastically **reduces computational overhead** ‚ö° and enables **efficient ligand docking** using **AutoDock Vina** üî¨, making the process significantly **faster and more scalable** üöÄ.
