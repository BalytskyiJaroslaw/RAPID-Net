# Training Pipeline for RAPID-Net

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks containing a complete training pipeline for the RAPID-Net model.

## Notebooks Overview

- **Training_Pockets_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**  
  This notebook is for preparing proteins and their corresponding labeled pockets used to train the RAPID-Net model. It includes all the necessary data preprocessing steps to ensure that the input data is properly formatted and ready for the RAPID-Net model training.

- **RAPID_Net_training.ipynb**  
  This notebook contains the actual process of training a RAPID-Net model on Google Colab.  
  **Note:** To train the RAPID-Net model, you do need access to an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Before starting the learning process, make sure you have the necessary hardware resources.

- **Follow instructions in the notebooks.**  Open the notebooks in Google Colab or your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment and run the notebooks sequentially to preprocess the data and train the RAPID-Net model.
   
Happy Training! 😊🏋️‍♂️💪
