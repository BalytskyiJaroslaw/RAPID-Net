# RAPID-Net: Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking  

![RAPID-Net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BalytskyiJaroslaw/RAPID-Net/main/RAPID_combine.png)

In this repository, we implement **RAPID-Net**, a Deep Learning model for accurate protein-ligand pocket identification, leading to improved ligand docking in the absence of prior knowledge of the binding site location. This work corresponds to our paper:

## Model Overview  

Unlike other Deep Learning models, RAPID-Net uses **soft labels** to account for uncertainty in pocket boundaries and **LÂ² Soft Dice loss function**, which provides more accurate and generalized pocket predictions. Additionally, our model integrates an attention mechanism. Interestingly, we found that removing redundant residual connections enhances performance, thus we refined the architecture accordingly. The model's design is illustrated below:

These predicted pockets provide accurate initial approximations for AutoDock Vina search grids, greatly improving docking efficiency and accuracy, as illustrated by the following example: 

## Pocket Prediction & Guided Docking Example by AutoDock Vina for 8F4J protein which AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole (but is processed smoothly by RAPID-Net ðŸ˜Š)

A complete example of pocket prediction for 8F4J and its use for guided docking is provided in this **Jupyter Notebook**:

8F4J protein is illustrated below:

In a similar way, using the same notebook, one can perform "blind" docking for any protein in PoseBusters and Astex Diverse Set.

A complete example of pocket prediction for ABHD5 protein, generation of initial ligand conformation from IUPAC or SMILES, the guided docking, and PLIP interaction profiling is provided in this **Jupyter Notebook**:
