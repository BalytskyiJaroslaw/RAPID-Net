In this repository, we implement **RAPID-Net**, a Deep Learning model for accurate protein-ligand pocket identification, leading to improved ligand docking in the absence of prior knowledge of the binding site location. Additionally, RAPID-Net can identify remote protein sites that indirectly affect ligand binding, providing a deeper understanding of protein-ligand interactions.

This work corresponds to our paper:

arXiv preprint, 2025.  

## Model Overview  

Unlike other Deep Learning models, RAPID-Net uses **soft labels** to account for uncertainty in pocket boundaries and **L¬≤ Soft Dice loss function**, which provides more accurate and generalized pocket predictions. Additionally, our model integrates an attention mechanism. Interestingly, we found that removing redundant residual connections enhances performance, thus we refined the architecture accordingly. The model's design is illustrated below:

These predicted pockets provide accurate initial approximations for AutoDock Vina search grids, greatly improving docking efficiency and accuracy, as illustrated by the following example: 

## Pocket Prediction & Guided Docking Example for 8F4J protein which AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole, but RAPID-Net handles it smoothly! üòä

A complete example of pocket prediction for 8F4J and its use for guided docking is provided in this **Jupyter Notebook**:  

‚û° **[8F4J Protein Docking Demonstration (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/15026755)**

8F4J protein is illustrated below:

In a similar way, using the same notebook, one can perform "blind" docking for any protein in PoseBusters and Astex Diverse Set.

## ABHD5 Docking Demonstration

A complete example of pocket prediction for ABHD5 protein, generation of initial ligand conformation from IUPAC or SMILES, the guided docking, and PLIP interaction profiling is provided in this **Jupyter Notebook**: 

‚û° **[ABHD5 Protein Docking Demonstration (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/15048009)**

A **clean version** of the notebook is available, which works for **any protein** (without the ABHD5-specific output).
