# RAPID-Net: Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking  

In this repository, we implement **RAPID-Net**, a Deep Learning model for accurate protein-ligand pocket identification, leading to improved ligand docking in the absence of prior knowledge of the binding site location. This work corresponds to our paper:

## Model Overview  

Unlike other Deep Learning models, RAPID-Net uses **soft labels** to account for uncertainty in pocket boundaries and **LÂ² Soft Dice loss function**, which provides more accurate and generalized pocket predictions. Additionally, our model integrates an attention mechanism. Interestingly, we found that removing redundant residual connections enhances performance, thus we refined the architecture accordingly. The model's design is illustrated below:

These predicted pockets provide accurate initial approximations for AutoDock Vina search grids, greatly improving docking efficiency and accuracy, as illustrated by the following example:

A complete example of pocket prediction for 8F4J and its use for guided docking is provided in this **Jupyter Notebook**:
